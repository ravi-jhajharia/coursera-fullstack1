				<h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
				<p>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]
					Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"					
					
					Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds. 
					It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9]

				<a name="burger"></a>
				<h3 class="text-center">Burger</h3>
				<p>A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked
				   patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced
				   bread roll or bun.The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked
				   or flame broiled.
				   A hamburger (also burger for short) is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked[1] or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[2]

				   The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity "burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or veggie burger.
				   
				   Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.

				<a name="falooda"></a>
				<h3 class="text-center">Falooda</h3>
				<p>Falooda is an Indian version of a cold dessert made with noodles.[1][2] It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh, variants of which are found across West, Central, and South Asia.[3] Traditionally it is made by mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk, often served with ice cream.[4] The vermicelli used for preparing falooda is made from wheat,[5] arrowroot, cornstarch, or sago.[6]
					The foundation of falooda goes back to Iran (Persia), where a similar dessert, faloodeh, was popular.[7] The dessert came to Medieval India with the many Muslim merchants and dynasties that settled in the Indian subcontinent in the 16th to 18th century.[7] The present form of falooda was developed in the Mughal Empire and spread with its conquests. Muslim rulers who succeeded from the Mughals patronized the dessert with their own adaptations, specifically in Hyderabad Deccan and the Carnatic areas of present-day India.[2] This dessert is now a major part of Pakistani and Bangladeshi culture, specially served on Islamic holidays, weddings and other occasions. It is also a well known part of Sri Lankan modern culture.
